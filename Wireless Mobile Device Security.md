**Types of Wireless Networks**

- Wireless PANs
- Wireless MANs
- Wireless WANs

**Characteristics of Wireless Communication Systems**

- Mobility
- Reachability
- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Roaming Services
- New Services

**Fundamentals Of Wireless LANs**
- Called LAWN ( Local Area Wireless Networks )
- WLAN is one in which a mobile user can connect to the LAN through a wireless connection
- Provides high speed data communication in small areas such as a building or an office
- Used to save costs and avoid laying cables
- IEEE 802.11 group of standards defines the technologies for wireless LANs

- examples of WLANs - Motorola's ALTAIR

**COMPONENTS OF WLANS**
- **Stations (STA)**

- **Basic Service Set (BSS)**
![[Pasted image 20230807121408.png]]

- **Extended Service Set (ESS)** - Set of all connected BSS
- **Distribution System (DS)** - It connects access points in ESS

**Types of WLANs**
- I**Infrastructure mode** - Mobile devices or clients connect to an access point (AP) that in turn connects to the internet via a bridge
- **Ad Hoc Mode** - Clients transfer frames directly to each other in a peer to peer fashion
	- eg. ( Bluetooth )

**Advantages of WLANs**

- Flexibility
- Planning
- Design
- Robustness
- Cost
- Ease of Use

**Disadvantages of WLANs**
- Quality of Services - Typically lower than wired networks. Main reason is due to the limitations in radio transmissions
- Proprietary Solutions
- Restrictions
- Global Operation
- Low Power
- License Free Operations
- Robust Transmission Technology

## Personal Area Networks (PAN)

- Wireless PANs - connected through signals like zigBee, Bluetooth
- Wired PANs - Connected through wires, eg) USB

## Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN)

- Fast communication networks within a metropolitan area
- Designed for larger geographic areas  than a LAN
- The standard of MAN is DQDB (Distributed-Queue-Dual-Bus-Network) which covers upto 30 miles and the speed is around 34 Mbits/s to 155 Mbits/s
- More common in schools, colleges
- The technology consists of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), FDDI and SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service)

## Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)

- Connecting fixed temporary locations, vehicles and IoT devices through highly reliable cellular broadband
- WWANs are highly reliable, flexible, scalable and cost effective

## 7 OSI Layers

- Physical Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data-Link Layer
- Physical Layer


## IEEE Architecture

- Stations - Comprise of all devices and equipment that are connected to the wireless LAN
	- Wireless Access Points ( WAP )
	- Client
- Basic Service Set - It is a group of stations communicating at the physical layer level
	- Infrastructure BSS - communicate through Access Points (APs)
	- Independent BSS - communicate in a peer-t-peer basis in an ad-hoc(temporary) manner 

## IEEE Wireless LAN standards

- All standards use carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
- They have support for both centralized base station as well as ad-hoc networks
