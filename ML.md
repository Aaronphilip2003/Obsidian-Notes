Given 2,4,10,12,3,20,30,11,25
assume  k=2

To perform k-means clustering with k=2 on the given set of numbers {2, 4, 10, 12, 3, 20, 30, 11, 25}, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize two cluster centroids randomly from the given data points. Let's choose 3 and 20 as the initial centroids.

2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.

Centroid 1 (3): {2, 3, 4}
Centroid 2 (20): {10, 11, 12, 20, 25, 30}

3. Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster.

New Centroid 1 = (2 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 3
New Centroid 2 = (10 + 11 + 12 + 20 + 25 + 30) / 6 = 18

4. Reassign data points to the nearest new centroid.

Centroid 1 (3): {2, 3, 4}
Centroid 2 (18): {10, 11, 12, 20, 25, 30}

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids stop changing or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Since the centroids did not change after the first iteration, the algorithm has converged, and we have the final clusters:

Cluster 1: {2, 3, 4}
Cluster 2: {10, 11, 12, 20, 25, 30}

Therefore, the k-means algorithm with k=2 has partitioned the given set of numbers into two clusters: {2, 3, 4} and {10, 11, 12, 20, 25, 30}.
