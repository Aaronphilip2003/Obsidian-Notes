**ENVIRONMENT TYPES -**

**Fully observable** -When an agent can determine the state of the system at all times, it is called fully observable.

**Partially observable** - When an agent cannot determine the state of the system at all times, it is called fully observable.

**Deterministic** - Deterministic AI environments are those on which the outcome can be determined base on a specific state

**Stochastic** - Stochastic algorithms are used in artificial intelligence technology to solve problems based on probabilities

**Complete** - These environments are those on which  at any given time we have enough information to complete a branch of the problem

**Episodic** - Episodic environments are a series of one-shot actions, and only the current (or recent) percept is relevant
