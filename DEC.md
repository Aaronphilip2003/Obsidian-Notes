## Data Mining
- Data Mining is also called knowledge discovery and Data Mining
- It is extraction of useful patterns from data sources
	- Databases
	- Texts
	- Web
	- Images
- Patterns must be 
	- Valid
	- Novel
	- Potentially useful
	- Understandable
- 5 widely used Data Mining Tools
	- **Weka**
	- **RapidMiner**
	- **Knime**
	- **Orange Data Mining**
	- **Rattle**
- Data mining is also extraction of interesting and potentially useful patterns from huge amounts of data


## Application (Pattern Recognition)
MIT
- Vehicles 
	- Mornings
	- During the lunch break
	- After college hours
- No. Of People
	- More during Admission season
	- Lesser during public holidays/weekends
- Student Performance:
	- Higher academic performance during the middle of the semester (midterm period).
	- More study activity before final exams
- Campus Maintenance
	- More maintenance activities during semester breaks.
	- Regular maintenance tasks during operational periods.

## Data Mining Algorithms

- Model - is to be fit on the data
- Preference - criteria to select one model over the other
- Search - techniques to evaluate data point or searching of data
## Goal of Data mining

- It is to provide efficient tools and techniques for KDD

## Types of data

1. Discrete Data
2. Continuous data

| Discrete Data        | Continuous Data                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Countable and finite | Data that falls in continuous sequence |
| can be sorted        | Cannot be sorted                       |

## Classify the following as discrete or continuous

1.  Number of telephones - Discrete
2. Size of french fries - Contunuous + interval
3. Ownership of cell phone - Discrete + nominal
4. Number of local phone calls you made in a month - Discrete 
5. Length of longest phone call - Discrete
6. Length of your foot - Discrete + ratio
7. Price of notebook - Discrete 
8. Zip Code - Discrete + interval
9. Temperature in Fahrenheit - Continuous
10. Temperature in Celsius - a
11. Temperature in Kelvin - Discrete
